# Introduction

The Food Truck Locator is an App Engine app that shows a map with the location of food trucks in an area.  Food trucks that are displayed on this map are done so by aggregating data from google calendar feeds and information from twitter.  In addition to the information displayed on the map, a set of web services is provided to build out third party applications.  Finally, the food truck locator publishes information about food trucks to configurable tweet bots that are associated with a location in the area.
