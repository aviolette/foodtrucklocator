    <h1>Using a Tracking Device</h1>
    <p class="lead">We will gladly set you up with tracking device that sends a direct signal to The Food Truck Finder.
      The tracking devices plug into your OBD port or wire into the ignition (depending on the age of the food truck).
      They send location, as well as diagnostic information (fuel level, battery charge, etc) that we display in the
      vendor portal. The location data is then used to show your truck on the food truck map.</p>
    <p class="lead">Via the vendor portal, you can link your various social media accounts and The Food Truck Finder
      will
      automatically share your location with your customers. It also hooks into this site's various social media
      accounts and apps which will also send out notifications of your location.</p>

    <p class="lead">Contact me via email at aviolette @ chicagofoodtruckfinder.com or via phone at 847-863-4992 for more
      information or to purchase a device.</p>
