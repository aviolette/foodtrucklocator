    The ${website}'s mission is to help people find food trucks. It publishes your truck's schedule on this website and
    linked applications. It publishes alerts via linked applications and social media accounts targeted at users who are
    interested in food trucks at a specific location. It provides tools for the truck owner to help you control the display
    of your data on this website via <a href="/vendor">the vendor portal</a>.

    <h1>How to Publish Your Location on the Food Truck Finder</h1>
    <p>The ideal way to put your truck on my website is a combination of a tracking device + advanced schedules
      specified in the vendor portal or a published calendar.</p>

    <h2>Tracking Device</h2>
    <p>I sell a tracking device that can be plugged into your truck's OBD port or wired into your ignition. Once you
      plug
      this device in, and do some minor instrumentation on my website, your truck will automatically show on my website
      and
      send out alerts to your customers via social media.</p>

    <h2>Vendor Portal</h2>
    <p>You can directly add your schedule to my website via <a href="/vendor">the vendor portal.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-3">
    <h2>Published Calendar</h2>
    <p>You can put your schedule in a google calendar or iCal calendar. I can read it in and automatically update your
      schedule on my website.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-3">
    <h2>Social Media Scanning</h2>
    <p>
      This has long been the most popular way of putting your stops on my website. My site will read in tweets, find out
      the
      location and time information and put them on my website. I have always considered this a stop-gap solution, and
      not an accurate way to put your truck on my website.
